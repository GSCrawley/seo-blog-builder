Based on the steps outlined:

1.  **Orchestration Strategy Clarified:** A decision was made to use **CrewAI** as the primary agent orchestration framework, aligning with the architecture document. This means the custom `Orchestrator` class will be phased out in favor of `CrewManager`, `AgentFactory`, and `TaskFactory`.
2.  **Niche Research Agent Refinement (Code Generated):** The specific tools (`KeywordResearchTool`, `SerpAnalysisTool`), task definition (`create_niche_research_task`), and agent configuration (`create_niche_research_agent`) for the Niche Research Specialist within the CrewAI framework have been defined. Code for these components has been generated.

**Current Status:**

The project is in the **early stages of implementing the CrewAI-based agent architecture**. The foundational decision on the orchestration tool is made, and the first specialized agent (Niche Research) has its initial code structure defined for the CrewAI setup.

**Next Immediate Steps:**

1.  **Integrate Generated Code:** Add the generated Python code for the Niche Research agent, task, and tools into the respective files (`app/tools/seo_tools.py`, `app/crew/tasks.py`, `app/crew/agent_factory.py`).
2.  **Refactor API/Workflow:** Update the relevant API endpoints (e.g., in `app/api/routes/blog_generator.py` or `app/api/routes/projects.py`) and the background workflow function (`process_blog_workflow` in `app/api/routes/blog_generator.py`) to utilize the `CrewManager` and the newly defined CrewAI agents/tasks, replacing calls to the old `Orchestrator`.
3.  **Implement Remaining Agents/Tasks:** Define and generate code for the other specialized agents (Client Requirements, SEO Strategy, Content Planning, etc.) and their corresponding tasks within the CrewAI framework, following the pattern established for the Niche Research agent.
